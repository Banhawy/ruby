#Creating the Meal, Tip, and Tax variables
meal= 20 	#Base-price of the meal
tax= 12		#Tax rate of the meal
tip= 20		#Tip rate of the meal	

#Using these initial variables, the script assigns four additional variables:
tax_value= meal*tax/100
meal_with_tax= meal + tax_value
tip_value= meal * tip/100
total_cost= meal_with_tax + tip_value

#Outputting the subtotals and costs to screen
puts "The pre-tax cost of your meal was $%.2f." %meal
puts "The tax value is: $#{tax_value} "
puts "At %d%%, tax for this meal is $%.2f." %[tax,tax_value]
puts "The tip value is: $#{tip_value}"
puts "For a %d%% tip, you should leave $%.2f." %[tip, tip_value]
puts "The grand total for this meal is then $%.2f." %total_cost
